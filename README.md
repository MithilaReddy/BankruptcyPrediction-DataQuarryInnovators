# BankruptcyPrediction-DataQuarryInnovators

## Project Overview
Predicting financial distress and firm bankruptcy has been a long-standing challenge in economics. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric measures to assess the financial condition of a company and forecast its future prospects for long-term market operation.

The project aims to build a robust model that can effectively classify firms into two categories: financially distressed (bankrupt) or financially healthy (non-bankrupt). The evaluation metric for this project is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC).

## Objectives
- Explore and preprocess the dataset, handling missing values and outliers.
- Engineer relevant features from the available econometric measures.
- Implement and compare various machine learning models for binary classification.
- Optimize the models to achieve the highest possible AUC score.
- Analyze the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project contains various econometric measures and features related to firms' financial health. The target variable is a binary indicator of whether a firm is bankrupt or non-bankrupt.

## Evaluation
The primary evaluation metric for this project is the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC). Model with a higher AUC score indicates better performance.
